# About
This is a **very dangerous** *worm* **it spreads true USB, email and internet**.
The **payloads are evolving constantly**. When you start *Loveware*, after a while there will be a pink terminal screen in front of you
it will ask you:*"Do you love me? (only answer with yes or no)"*.
If you choose **no** then you need to know that your computer is **doomed**.
Some very nasty payloads will start that will kill your computer in the end.
If you choose *yes* you will be able to **recover your files** or **maybe use your
computer** after some **fun payloads**.

Thats it for now I hope you enjoy our *"little project"*
